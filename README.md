# TICTACTOE

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using CLI written in Java. The code can be improved and features can be implemented further.

You can type commands to compile and launch :

```
javac *.java
java Main
```

Or use an IDE to avoid typing those.

There are two modes :
- Player vs Player
- IA vs IA

For the second players chose randomly and there is no learning from previous games. It will be improved soon.
